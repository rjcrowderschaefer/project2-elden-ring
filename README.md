In this project we have made a wiki for the hit game Elden Ring! In this wiki you will be able to learn about many of the wonderfull and fun things Elden Ring has to offer. 

Included in this wiki are:
~ Character Information ~
~Classes 
~Keepsakes 
~Stats
~Status Effects 
~Equipment and Magic~
~Damage Types
~Spells
~Tailsmans
~Weapons

For this Wiki Page we hope bring a easy flowing experience where the user can flawlessly go from page to page and find the information they need quickly and efficiently.

We have CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) In this wiki where you can for example create a new class, being able to read what is made, then you can update a current or old class with new information, and finally be able to delete any and all classes if you so choose. Classes was just a example used. You can do this on any and all options we have on the webpage.
